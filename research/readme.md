The biggest problem is proving trust can be measured. So that's where the research will start, in graph theory and social networks.

Research papers will be collected here. These will, hopefully, provide a direction or basis for calculating trust metrics. With that,aA proof of concept will be developed to simulate a realistic social network and calculate trust metrics.

Tasks
1. collect research
2. read, comprehend
3. determine, or perhaps develop a methodology for measuring trust
4. develop algorithm for calculating trust
5. develop proof of concept

Following this, the identity system will be the focus. Collecting research regarding cryptography/ZKPs and biometrics so that the methods of both proving identity and protecting privacy can be achieved. Then following this, comes the discussion aspects.. particularly the idea of predicting bins for comments based on past categorizations of comments.
