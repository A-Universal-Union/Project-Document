# Overview
[The project document (i.e. latest md file)](project.v3.5.md) outlines a framework we propose grafting onto any collaborative collective. Specifically with the intent of realigning democracy for the global era. We describe a tool intended for providing a vehicle through which any collection of humans can organize themselves in any way imaginable. If you want an anarchist state, you can do that now. If you want liquid democracy where every citizen has the right to vote on every single thing to pass through the government, you can do that. If "you" want to run a dictatorship, you can make that work too I'm sure.. probably for a little while at least.

The framework relies on or describes a few main ideas which this will be an attempt to shorthand:
 A townhall type space, like Twitter but self moderated. Language tools like LLMs or NLP. Identifying echo chambers from any particular person's perspective. Democratic processes; e.g. voting. Social graphs as a basis for trust analytics. Collective forming (requirements optional e.g. government ID). Anonymized interactions.

Before you dismiss this, wait a moment and consider this. Suppose every person on the planet would really love to hop on a maglev train and be able to reach near to any destination on the earth. What would that take? A massive amount of infrastructure. What would it take to have an insane amount of infrastructure? Well, in the current social paradigm it would be simply trillions - if not more - of dollars. Suppose instead, all those people who cared were also willing to help build it. Imagine organizing that. That's the scale our civilization is at, right now, we've simply been unable to create the tools to support a new way of co-existing at scale.
